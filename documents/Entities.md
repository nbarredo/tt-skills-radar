Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the entities that would be essential for creating a new web application for the Techie Skills Radar:

## Entity Analysis for Techie Skills Radar Web App

The core of the web application will revolve around managing and displaying information about Techies, their skills, and related organizational structures. The following entities are identified along with their key attributes and relationships:

### 1. Knowledge Area

- **Purpose**: To categorize skills and talent by broad domains of expertise[cite: 30].
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier[cite: 30].
  - `name`: Name of the knowledge area (e.g., "Project Management", "Programming", "Cloud Computing")[cite: 30].
  - `description`: Details about the area, problems addressed, and key skills needed[cite: 30].
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many with `Skill`: A Knowledge Area can contain multiple Skills.

### 2. Skill Category

  - `values`: The specific values or qualifiers within the scale (e.g., "1 to 5", "bad, regular, good", "A, B, C")[cite: 31].
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many with `MemberSkill` (or similar linking entity): A Scale is used to rate a Member's proficiency in a Skill.

### 5. Member (Techie)

- **Purpose**: Represents an individual Techie within the company[cite: 18].
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (Primary Key): System-generated unique identifier.

  - `location`: Techie's geographical location[cite: 18].
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-Many with `Skill`: A Member possesses multiple Skills with a specific proficiency.
  - One-to-One with `Member Profile`: A Member has one detailed profile.

### 6. Member Profile

- **Purpose**: To store detailed information about a Techie's professional journey and soft details[cite: 32].
- **Attributes**:
  - `id` (Primary Key): System-generated unique identifier.
  - `member_id` (Foreign Key): Links to the associated `Member`.
  - `assignments`: List of past and current project assignments[cite: 32].
  - `roles_and_tasks`: Roles and tasks the Techie can take in a team[cite: 32].
  - `appreciations_from_clients`: Positive feedback or recognition from clients (potentially linked to "Techie Points")[cite: 32].
  - `feedback_comments`: General feedback comments[cite: 32].
  - `periods_in_talent_pool`: Information about times spent in a talent pool[cite: 32].
  - `about_me`: A textual description about the Techie (implied from example profile image).
  - `bio`: A short biography (implied from example profile image).
  - `contact_info`: Email, Work phone, Cell phone, Skype (implied from example profile image).
  - `social_connections`: LinkedIn, Twitter (implied from example profile image).
  - `status`: Current work status (e.g., "I'm working on developing skills through my IDP") (implied from example profile image).
  - `badges`: List of badges earned (implied from example profile image).
  - `certifications`: List of certifications with details (implied from example profile image).
  - `assessments`: List of assessment results with scores (implied from example profile image).
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-One with `Member`.

### 7. MemberSkill (Junction Table)

- **Purpose**: To link `Member` and `Skill` entities and store the Techie's proficiency level for a given skill.
- **Attributes**:
  - `member_id` (Foreign Key): Links to `Member`.
  - `skill_id` (Foreign Key): Links to `Skill`.
  - `proficiency_score`: The rating of the skill based on a `Scale`.
  - `scale_id` (Foreign Key): Links to the `Scale` used for this proficiency rating.
- **Relationships**:
  - Many-to-One with `Member`.
  - Many-to-One with `Skill`.
  - Many-to-One with `Scale`.

### Other Considerations / Potential Future Entities:

- **Client**: Although `current_assigned_client` is an attribute of `Member`, a separate `Client` entity might be beneficial if more detailed client information (e.g., contact details, industry) is needed or if historical client assignments need a more structured representation beyond a simple list.
- **Assignment**: The `List of assignments` in `Member Profile` could evolve into a separate `Assignment` entity if detailed information about each assignment (e.g., project name, start/end dates, role on project) needs to be stored and queried.
- **Assessment**: The examples show "Sales Proficiency Exam" and "Management Strategy Exam" with scores[cite: 23]. A dedicated `Assessment` entity could store details about the assessment itself (name, type, total score), and a `MemberAssessment` entity could link a Techie to their result on a specific assessment.
- **Certification**: Similar to assessments, `Certifications` could be their own entity, linked to `Member` via a `MemberCertification` table to store details like license number and date obtained.
- **Badge**: If badges have associated metadata beyond just a name and image, a `Badge` entity could be considered.
- **User Roles/Permissions**: The system describes different user groups (Techies, Sales, Solutions, People, Production) with varying needs[cite: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. This indicates a need for a robust user authentication and authorization system, likely involving `User` and `Role` entities.

This entity analysis provides a strong foundation for designing the database schema and developing the web application's core functionalities.
